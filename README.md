# Tiled-Introduction
In this session we will be making our own tile-based platformer using a combination of [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)

Credit to [ansimuz](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art) for the pixel art, some of which has been slightly modified.
